  "lead": "ELEY force is a high-velocity, semi-automatic .22LR round. Designed for power, its new propellant accelerates the bullet for maximum knock-down force.",
  "description": [
    "ELEY force is our high-velocity, semi-automatic .22LR round, engineered for power and performance. Using a purpose-designed propellant with a distributed pressure curve, force accelerates the bullet to supersonic velocity, delivering greater energy on impact and the pronounced kickback shooters expect from a recreational power round.",
    "Built for shooters who want both impact and accuracy, ELEY force balances punch with precision. Each cartridge is manufactured to tight tolerances, so you get consistent muzzle performance."
