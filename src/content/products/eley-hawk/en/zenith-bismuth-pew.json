    "Taking the already outstanding properties of the fibre option to the next level, The Zenith Bismuth Pro Eco combines superior patterning qualities of the copper-coated lead shot with a hydro soluble shot cup to provide unmatched ballistics at range while supporting environmentally friendly credentials. The unique, certified Pro-Eco wad is 100% water-soluble and compostable, non-toxic and biodegradable, ensuring that no trace is left in the field. It dissolves fully submerged in water in approximately 24 hours and up to 3 months in natural elements.",
    "The unique formulation of the bismuth alloy has many properties similar to lead in terms of density and hardness. The alloy mix also ensures there is a certain malleability, which in turn transfers energy into the target to deliver superb knockdown power. Bismuth has no toxic properties and is very safe to handle.",
    "Available as 12 gauge 32g 4 shot and 36g 3 shot, loaded in a 70mm case."
