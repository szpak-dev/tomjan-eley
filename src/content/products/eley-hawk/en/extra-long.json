  "description": [
    "As the largest .410 load available, this cartridge has been formulated to deliver brilliant results in the field, making it a firm favourite among small-bore game shooting enthusiasts. Coming in 18 gram loads, it is more than capable for using on partridge days.",
    "The additional power has made this load the perfect choice for those who shoot .410s during the game season. It’s also only available in fibre.",
    "“Eley are the only manufacturer that produce fibre loads in .410 format. So well done to them!” ~ Shooting UK",
    "This cartridge is also available in a Hush Power subsonic variant which is ideal for vermin control to give a quiet performance in areas where noise considerations are a factor, such as shooting close to livestock or farm buildings."
