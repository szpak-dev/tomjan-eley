    "The unique blend of powders and slow-burning primers in the Superb, allow the barrel time to be regulated so it achieves smooth, yet powerful performance. They are loaded with specialist high antimony Magnum shot too.",
    "“A value for money cartridge that until now has somehow gone under my radar. On test, Eley Superbs have low recoil but are highly effective at long ranges. When I had finished shooting the Sporting layout, I retreated to the pattern plate where I was even further impressed.” ~"
