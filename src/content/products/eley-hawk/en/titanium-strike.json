    "“The ‘nickel effect’ showed itself in the distribution, where the proportion of pellets in the outer 20- to 30-inch zone was bolstered by the central density. The Titanium Strike are superb cartridges; they are definitely correctly billed as premium loads for the serious and dedicated shooter, and are specifically designed to pull back the longest of targets.\" ~",
    "A few of the main features include: a 25mm nickel-plated head for outstanding cartridge performance and smooth ejection; PSB+ powder specifically engineered in-house for high velocity and ultra-smooth recoil; and an Eley exclusive A-Type Plastic Wad for ultimate recoil reduction and delivery of dense patterns at all ranges."
