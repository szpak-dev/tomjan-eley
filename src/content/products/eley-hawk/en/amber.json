    "“I was proud to work with The UK's number one cartridge manufacturer to make a cartridge with low recoil, fast powders and magnum 5% antimony shot. The cartridge is fantastic at breaking clays and they have served me so well as I train and compete for Team GB.” ~",
    "Produced in 24 gram 8 shot, this cartridge has excellent patterns and delivers results every time you pull the trigger."
