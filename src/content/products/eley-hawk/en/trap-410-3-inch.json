    "Top marks were given by the coveted Shooting Industry Awards’ evaluators for breaking clays at distance. The concluded: “Packing a genuinely outstanding punch, this .410 load performed beyond expectations. The quality of kills in excess of 30 yards equal any high-performance competition load on both going away targets and typical sporting birds. And whilst these diminutive loads hit as hard as any cartridge you’ll encounter, recoil is – more or less – non-existent.",
    "“The .410 gun configuration has been given a real boost in popularity thanks to this fantastic cartridge. The specialist powder and magnum shot combine to make them an obvious choice for use in .410 clay competitions.”",
    "“It is an exceptional cartridge, especially when you consider it’s only 19g. They’re good, hard-hitting cartridges that produce genuinely impressive kills. There’s no recoil: the cartridges themselves are well-made and presented. In my opinion, the market has always required a quality competition .410 load, and to my mind this Eley offering is it!”"
