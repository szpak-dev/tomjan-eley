    "Top marks were given by the coveted Shooting Industry Awards’ evaluators for breaking clays at distance. The concluded: “Packing a genuinely outstanding punch, this .410 load performed beyond expectations. The quality of kills in excess of 30 yards equal any high-performance competition load on both going away targets and typical sporting birds. And whilst these diminutive loads hit as hard as any cartridge you’ll encounter, recoil is – more or less – non-existent.",
    "“The .410 gun configuration has been given a real boost in popularity thanks to this fantastic cartridge. The specialist powder and magnum shot combine to make them an obvious choice for use in .410 clay competitions.”",
    "“The new Eley Trap .410 is such a genuinely outstanding load, it could well become solely responsible for whole new levels of appreciation of this oft-maligned and overlooked bore, to an extent I for one have seriously had to re-evaluate my attitude towards .410 shotguns.” ~"
