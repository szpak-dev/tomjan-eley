  "description": [
    "This classic load for the .410 comes in a 2 inch length and is particularly well suited to the finely balanced 36 gauge.",
    "“Inside barns and rearing sheds for nesting birds, rats are likely to be a problem. Here I’d suggest the ideal solution is the Eley Hawk two-inch .410, which delivers a 9gm payload of No. 6 shot.”",
    "Loaded with a very special SSB+ 150 powder the 2” cartridge is ideal for use on ground game and vermin."
