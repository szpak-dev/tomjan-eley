    "“I was proud to work with The UK's number one cartridge manufacturer to make a cartridge with low recoil, fast powders and magnum 5% antimony shot. The cartridge is fantastic at breaking clays and they have served me so well as I train and compete for Team GB.” ~",
    "Ensuring that 20 bore users are well catered, Eley Hawk have developed the championship-winning formula of the 12 bore cartridge into the 20 bore. They are loaded in a pastel yellow case with Amber’s signature low recoil system and CSB 2 powders for quick acceleration and blistering clay breaks.",
    "You’ll struggle to find a better 20 bore clay load."
