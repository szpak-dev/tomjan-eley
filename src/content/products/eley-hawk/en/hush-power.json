    "With fast burning powder and a subsonic delivery, there is a significant drop in the sound generated when firing these cartridges albeit still producing outstanding ballistics. This load is the best solution for grounds with noise restrictions in place.",
    "“While a helpful volunteer prepared to shoot some samples of this cartridge, I retreated to what I considered a suitable distance to listen to some muffled reports. Not very scientific I grant you, but, yes, at about 250 yards they were considerably quieter. I also shot some Hush Power myself and they broke targets convincingly at some competitive distances.”"
