  "description": [
    "Eley Hawk was the first to manufacture this type of load, and that innovation has been carried forward with this cartridge’s fibre-only wad for impressive results – no other UK manufacturer produces such a load.",
    "“A brambled bank, a handful of Eley Fourlong cartridges, bright winter sun and a borrowed gun and a dog. Three rabbits were bowled over cleanly at distances up to 20 paces. I must admit, for the first time in years, I began to look upon the .410 in a new and favourable light.”",
    "Loaded with a very special SSB+ 150 powder the 2 ½” cartridge is ideal for use on ground game and vermin."
