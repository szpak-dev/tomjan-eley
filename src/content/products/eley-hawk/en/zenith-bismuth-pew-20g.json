  "description": [
    "The use of bismuth shot makes these cartridges highly effective for traditional game species such as pheasants and grouse, while also being safe to use in older, classic shotguns that cannot handle steel shot. Bismuth's density and softness closely mimic that of lead, providing excellent energy transfer and knock-down power, ensuring clean, ethical kills in the field.",
    "The Pro Eco Wad design adds an environmentally conscious touch, utilizing a fully biodegradable fiber wad that breaks down naturally, reducing plastic waste in the countryside. This makes the Zenith Bismuth Pro Eco Wad cartridges a responsible choice for hunters who prioritize both performance and sustainability. With the 20-gauge option, these cartridges are perfect for shooters seeking a lighter gun without sacrificing the high-quality performance Eley Hawk is known for, offering reliable patterns and great effectiveness for game shooting."
