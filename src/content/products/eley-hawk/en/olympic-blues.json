  "description": [
    "For two generations this has been the perfect choice cartridge for those transitioning into competitive shooting – garnering a following of club shooters and instructors who will shoot nothing else.",
    "“A favourite of top British Olympic Trap shooters in the 1970s, but they have more than nostalgia to offer. Delivering a muzzle velocity of 1375 fps with a 2¾” case, they will constantly break targets at long ranges and put a smile on the clubman’s face.” ~",
    "With an extensive range of loads available and wadded in plastic and fibre, this cartridge can cover all disciplines exceptionally well."
