    "Designed with low recoil and crisp firing in mind, the product delivers great ballistics even at range. With multiple loads available – including a light 21g load for beginners, those sensitive to recoil or of a slender build – they are suitable for every discipline.",
    "“Eley Hawk Select are comfortable to shoot. You will know you could shoot a great many without discomfort – useful for maintaining concentration. Overall the new Select proved able to tackle closer to mid-range targets very well – often these make up most of the targets a Sporting layout, making it a cost-effective choice. These are also smooth operators – try some and you may be pleasantly surprised.” ~",
    "What makes this cartridge perform in the way it does, is a slightly higher head and very comfortable speed to recoil ratio. The 21g load is ideal for taking lessons and introducing new people to the sport; the 24g load is a good intermediate step-up and a perfect cartridge for simulated clay shoots; and the 28 gram load has been used to great effect by new shooters getting into competitions posting scores they can be proud of.",
    "The powders used change to match the specific load and fibre or plastic wadding, and the shorter 67mm case allows the cartridge to be safely used in all guns."
