    "VIP Game cartridges deliver consistent patterning at fast speeds with comfortable recoil to ensure clean kills at impressive ranges. Even after a day firing a lot of shells, you will find minimal powder or residue in the barrels thanks to the premium powders.",
    "“They deliver everything one could possibly want in a game cartridge; outstanding patterns, fast speeds, convincing knock-down power, low recoil, and consistent quality. We have used over 100,000 VIPs at Linhope in the past three years with not one misfire. Impressive quality.” ~ Lord James Percy, Renowned Game Shot",
    "Once you shoot with Eley VIP's nothing else is quite the same. Superior patterning and ballistics ensure the best in class performance."
