  "description": [
    "The Grand Prix High Velocity 12 gauge has a bigger 32 gram load and increased speeds than the traditional Grand Prix cartridges. For the difficult to hit birds where speed is a necessity, the PSB +1 powder propels shot past that critical 1350 fps.",
    "“This cartridge is much more than just an established brand. Faster powders and meticulous standards of manufacture ensure Grand Prix sets a pace for those seeking performance” ~",
    "The Grand Prix Velocity comes in the iconic orange case colour."
