  "description": [
    "It is a truly universal field cartridge encompassing all aspects of game and vermin control, with the widest variety of shot and wad combinations suitable for all gun configurations, including semi-autos.",
    "Loaded in a 67mm case configuration with a full range of loads from 28, 30 and 32 gram, these have been used by game shooters, pest controllers and rough shooters alike to great effect and have become a sought-after cartridge.",
    "“This flexible cartridge in its unique 67mm case works in all gun types, and is a true all-rounder with power and performance to match. I particularly like the bright-coloured cases as they look great and are easy to spot when picking up spent shells. You don’t need to be a high flyer to use hi-flyers.” ~"
