  "description": [
    "Loaded in 32 gram 6 shot with a new 70mm case, the fibre wad Pigeon HVs pack a punch and work in all gun types and provides a smooth ejection in semi autos. The CSB 2 powder extends the range of the cartridge for far out pigeons, while remaining consistent with comfortable recoil.",
    "“On the flight line I found Eley Pigeon HVs to be both hugely effective and consistent, even at long ranges. This should come as no surprise – as an integrated manufacturer with all their components from powder to shot developed and produced in-house we can expect nothing less.” ~"
