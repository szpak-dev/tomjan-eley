  "lead": "ELEY tenex is the world’s most consistently accurate .22LR cartridge.",
  "description": [
    "With over 198 years of heritage and experience, engineering excellence is central to the success of ELEY tenex. Our highly skilled engineers combine state of the art machinery with high speed electronic visual inspection systems and Six Sigma methodologies to produce the cartridges that have redefined .22LR accuracy across the world.",
    "The iconic flat nose projectile of ELEY tenex is one of many innovations pioneered by ELEY engineers. As it cuts through the air its revolutionary design pulls the centre of pressure forwards, aerodynamically stabilizing the projectile and increasing accuracy at the target.",
    "Precise manufacturing techniques form cartridge cases of uniform length from a tightly controlled brass alloy. This ensures each propellant charge burns in a controlled volume, delivering consistent energy to each projectile.",
    "Next, each cartridge is checked by a suite of analytical processes including computer controlled visual inspection and finely calibrated measuring equipment, all overseen by our extremely precise and meticulous engineers.",
    "To achieve ultimate accuracy with ELEY tenex, a shooter should test their barrel. While ELEY tenex will offer unrivalled results as standard, matching the barrel and ammunition at our technical test ranges could make the crucial difference in a competition."
