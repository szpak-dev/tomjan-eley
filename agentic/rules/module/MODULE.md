# Module Rules

Document Class: leaf

## Purpose

A module has one public boundary reached through one public seam.

## Applies When

Use this file for module-shape work after the governing feature or task bootstrap has identified that module structure is the right level of concern.

## Scope

This file governs module form, public seam design, private internals, and dependency direction once module structure is the right level of concern.

## Core Rules

### Form

1. Use a single file while the module is simple.
2. Convert the module to a folder only when private composition is needed.
3. A folder module is composition behind one public seam.
4. Do not create a folder before there is private structure to hide.

### Public API

1. Expose the minimum public API.
2. Widen it only when multiple external consumers need it or an approved plan requires it.
3. Do not widen it to avoid local wiring work.
4. Callers import through the public seam only.
5. Do not use a module API to bypass or dilute the owning feature boundary.

### Internals

1. Keep helpers, policies, services, and intermediate models private.
2. Split internal parts by responsibility.
3. Deep imports into internal files are forbidden.

### Dependencies

1. Dependencies stay directional.
2. Circular dependencies are forbidden.
3. A parent may depend on a child module's public seam only.
4. A child must not depend on its consumer.
5. Inside a feature, module dependencies must also respect the governing feature anatomy.

## Constraints

1. Do not widen the public API to avoid local wiring work.
2. Do not bypass or dilute the owning feature boundary through the module API.
3. Do not deep-import internal files.
4. Do not create a folder before private structure exists.
5. Do not allow circular dependencies.

## Acceptance Check

1. The module uses the simplest valid form.
2. The public boundary and public seam are clear.
3. Public API is minimal.
4. Internal files stay private.
5. No caller needs a deep import.
